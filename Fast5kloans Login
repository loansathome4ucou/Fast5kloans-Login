What exactly is a payday loan? A payday loan is a fast and quick method to get some extra money. In most cases, you can easily get a loan of $500. You can get the money by verifying your income source and your debit card. It is a risky method but does not involve your home, car, and other possessions. Payday loans are granted on the promise that the amount will be returned when the borrower will receive his next pay. Usually, your monthly income is the only source of verification for the company to grant you the loan. However, every company has their own criteria. Generally there are two types of loans available. The first, considered an in-store loan, allows you to visit the physical location of the establishment and you will receive your payday advance in person. Usually, the process takes about 15 minutes and you will get your money right there. The second is considered an online advance. You will submit an application online providing your paycheck information, bank account information and references. Generally, the money from the advance is deposited into your personal account within one business day.
